# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: diy.sh

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script

            ## 以下为常用科学上网插件（每日定时更新）
            使用方式：
              1. 软路由后台-系统-软件包-过滤器-查找你要替换的IPK（如passwall，你就搜passwall就行）-移除
              2. 下载下面对应的IPK文件， 软路由后台-系统-文件传输-选择本地文件-选择ipk上传-上传文件列表-安装
            注意：单独上传IPK可能会因为依赖问题无法正确使用，还是建议刷新固件。
